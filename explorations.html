<h1>Explorations in Gaming</h1>

<h2 id="board">Board Game Exploration</h2>
<p>When I was first assigned this exploration to complete with my group, the first step was to pick a game that we wanted to be inspired by. The game we wanted to 
    resemble was Monopoly. In this case, we wanted to pick a board that was similar to it in a way. 
    To be more creative and fun, we included different game pieces that could be easily differentiated when playing the game. 
 Our player pieces include different things like lego humans and dinosaurs. 
 Similar to Monopoly, the pieces will move the same which is forward only from the start point to the end point. 
 Unlike Monopoly, there would be no assets for us to collect during the game. The player is meant to get to the end/finish line first before the other players and the fun in this is the anticipation. 
 Another main component of the game being used is the dice which determines how many spaces a play piece can move. At the end, we came up with the name of our game which is
    "Agressions." Aggressions is a multiplayer board game that uses dice and physical characters. 
    Players must race to the finish line to win the game. 1-3 or 4-6? What will you roll? Who will win? All of this depends on luck and the magical dice. </p>

        <h2> Rules!</h2>
        
    <p> The rules to our game were really simple and understandable: 
        <ul>
            <li> 1. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first. The rest of the players will roll and the order of play will be from greatest number to lowest number. </li>
            <li> 2. Roll the dice and then see what number you get. All the directions you move are dependent on what you land on the game board. </li>
        <li> 3. If you roll and land on the arrow, you roll again to determine the direction </li>
        <li> 4. Then, you move the amount that you roll. When it gets towards the end or by the finish line, if you roll too many at the star on the board, you have to go all the way back around. </li>
        <li> 5. After going around the board at a maximum of two times, once you get to the outlined red square, you can stay in it until you get to the finish line. </li>
        <li> 6. NOTE: When you go around the square at least 2 times, then you can go to the finish line on the final roll even if the number exceeds the amount of spaces you need to reach the finish line. </li>
        <li> 7. NOTE: The big dot on the board means that you need to land exactly on it to get moved to the 4-6 square. </li>
        <li> 8. NOTE: When you land on the same spot as another player, you can kick them off of the board. (This is the fun part) </li>
</ul>

<h2 id ="video">Video Game Exploration</h2>
<p> Below is an example of a flowchart and pseudocode that we used to create the actual code to our game. </p>

		<h2> Pseudocode: </h2> 
<pre>
  set score = 0
initialize player_location= (0,0)
set player_ram=0
set timer=45
set_trash=(random)
time=time_start

#This happens as a loop

if trash_collected=true
then set score=+1

else:
set_trash (random)
update score

if player_ram=True
call procedure_playerram

to procedure_playerram
	if player_location = out_of_parameters
	then set player_location = spawn point


else: time=time_remaining
clear screen
End game

 </pre>
                
<p> While discovering more about creating a video game, we knew that we wanted it to be fun and interactive. We then derived some of the code from the examples given in class.
  The created game is called: "Litterbugs." In this game, we are trying to prevent littering from continuing and to make better choices 
    when irresponsibly and carelessly disposing of trash. To measure the impact of the game, before we say the name of the game and give the instructions, 
    we give the players a form to answer regarding littering and then when they play the game, then as they play the game, quick facts will print on the screen. 
    After, we will send out a form again to see how much information they gained. </p>
