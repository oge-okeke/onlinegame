<h1>Explorations in Gaming</h1>

       <p> Before creating our game, we had to do some exploration which called for a creative idea of a board game. After gaining some inspiration,
	    we dove straight into our video game, but first we needed a format and exact idea on what our character would be doing. After creating that, 
	    we decided to each branch off to create pseudocode so that we can form a uniformed idea. The social impact engineer cross-checked all of our ideas to
	    ensure that we were getting  message out to our audience of gameplayers, YOU! </p>

<h2 id ="video">Video Game Exploration</h2>
<p> Below is an example of a flowchart and pseudocode that we used to create the actual code to our game. </p>

		<h2> Pseudocode: </h2> 
<pre>
  set score = 0
initialize player_location= (0,0)
set player_ram=0
set timer=45
set_trash=(random)
time=time_start

#This happens as a loop

if trash_collected=true
then set score=+1

else:
set_trash (random)
update score

if player_ram=True
call procedure_playerram

to procedure_playerram
	if player_location = out_of_parameters
	then set player_location = spawn point


else: time=time_remaining
clear screen
End game

 </pre>
                
<p> While discovering more about creating a video game, we knew that we wanted it to be fun and interactive. We then derived some of the code from the examples given in class.
  The created game is called: "Litterbugs." In this game, we are trying to prevent littering from continuing and to make better choices 
    when irresponsibly and carelessly disposing of trash. To measure the impact of the game, before we say the name of the game and give the instructions, 
    we give the players a form to answer regarding littering and then when they play the game, quick facts will print on the screen. 
    After, we will send out a form again to see how much information they gained. </p>

                
		<h2> Instructions </h2>
		<ul>
			
			<li>
				1. Sit in a controlled environment.
			</li>
			<li> 
				2. Take the pre-survey before playing our game. 
			</li>
			<li>
				3. Hold the cricket controller in your hand. 
			</li>
			<li>
				4. Press the spacebar on the computer to start the game.
			</li>
			<li>
				5. The right button on the cricket is to move to the right. The left button is to move Jim (the character) to the left.
				The A2 button is to move down and the A3 button is to move up.
			</li> 
			<li> 
				6. When you see trash appear, move Jim according to the instructions listed above.
			</li>
			<li> 
				7. You have 30 seconds to collect as much trash as possible, so have fun!
			</li>
			
			<li> 
				8. Lastly, take the post-survey so we can know how much you learned from our game/see how impactful our game is. 
			</li>
		</ul>
