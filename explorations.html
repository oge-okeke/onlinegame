<h2 id="board">Board Game Exploration</h2>
<p>When I was first assigned this exploration to complete with my group, the first step was to pick a game that we wanted to be inspired by. The game we wanted to 
    resemble was Monopoly. In this case, we wanted to pick a board that was similar to it in a way. 
    To be more creative and fun, we included different game pieces that could be easily differentiated when playing the game. 
 Our player pieces include different things like lego humans and dinosaurs. 
 Similar to Monopoly, the pieces will move the same which is forward only from the start point to the end point. 
 Unlike Monopoly, there would be no assets for us to collect during the game. The player is meant to get to the end/finish line first before the other players and the fun in this is the anticipation. 
 Another main component of the game being used is the dice which determines how many spaces a play piece can move. At the end, we came up with the name of our game which is
    "Agressions." Aggressions is a multiplayer board game that uses dice and physical characters. 
    Players must race to the finish line to win the game. 1-3 or 4-6? What will you roll? Who will win? All of this depends on luck and the magical dice. </p>

        <h2> Rules!</h2>
        
    <p> The rules to our game were really simple and understandable: 
        <ul>
            <li> 1. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first. The rest of the players will roll and the order of play will be from greatest number to lowest number. </li>
            <li> 2. Roll the dice and then see what number you get. All the directions you move are dependent on what you land on the game board. </li>
        <li> 3. If you roll and land on the arrow, you roll again to determine the direction </li>
        <li> 4. Then, you move the amount that you roll. When it gets towards the end or by the finish line, if you roll too many at the star on the board, you have to go all the way back around. </li>
        <li> 5. After going around the board at a maximum of two times, once you get to the outlined red square, you can stay in it until you get to the finish line. </li>
        <li> 6. NOTE: When you go around the square at least 2 times, then you can go to the finish line on the final roll even if the number exceeds the amount of spaces you need to reach the finish line. </li>
        <li> 7. NOTE: The big dot on the board means that you need to land exactly on it to get moved to the 4-6 square. </li>
        <li> 8. NOTE: When you land on the same spot as another player, you can kick them off of the board. (This is the fun part) </li>
</ul>

<h2 id ="video">Video Game Exploration</h2>
                <p> Here is some code to be explained below: <p>
                
<pre>
  def draw():
    if game_over:
        screen.draw.text("Final Score: " + str(score), topleft=(10, 10), fontsize=60)
          else:
        screen.fill("green")
        screen.clear()
        turkey.draw()
        screen.draw.text("Score: " + str(score), color="blue", topleft=(10, 10))
 </pre>
                
<p> While discovering more about creating a video game, I knew that I wanted it to be fun and interactive. I derived some of the code from the examples given in class.
  I created a game called "shoot the turkey." In this game, it requires a player to click a turkey that will appear at random places on the screen. The objective is 
    to reach the highest score possible within ten seconds without missing the turkey. This game is fun because it tests for accuracy and precision. Below is some piece
    of code that directly shows how I incorporated score keeping in the game which is a new skill that I learned on Youtube. The code below reads as follows:
    draw on the screen the final score as a string when the game is over. Draw the final score at the top left corner with the font size 60. 
    Else, if the game is not over, draw on the screen the current score during the ongoing game.</p>
