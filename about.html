        <h1>About the Game Creators!</h1>
        <p>
          On our team we have: Zofia, Oge, Daniel, and Saige. We are four high school students based in West Haven, CT.
            We all attend the Engineering and Science University Magnet School.
            
        <h2> Meet Zofia</h2>
        <p> Zofia's primary role is project manager and her secondary role is social impact engineer. For Zofia's roles, 
            he needs to make sure that our game reaches the correct audience and makes a 
            difference in the world whether that is a call to action or just staying informed. As the project manager, Zofia needs 
            to keep us all on task and make sure that we all are tackling a fair and equal amount of work. In his leisure time, his favorite game is 
            anything on Roblox.
   </p>
        
        <h2> Meet Oge </h2>
        <p> Oge's primary role is web designer and she is focusing on making sure our website is buisness ready. She includes every aspect that we worked on
            in this website. A secondary role that she works on is gameplay design. Oge reviews the way our game will work. 
            Oge leads and coordinates the design, testing, and revision of our game's play experience, including development of
            rules and instructions, and maximization of criteria like "flow" and "fiero." In her leisure time, she likes to play 
            "Dance Moms Roleplay." She likes this game because it is based on the show "Dance Moms" and it allows her to be in the setting 
            and create dance routines using the little tricks like spins, leaps, cartwheels, and more for pure entertainment.</p>
        
        <h2> Meet Daniel </h2>
        <p> Daniel's primary role is python programmer in which he is responsible for all the code that our game runs on. 
            He also worked on the pseudocode and python code, with the small assistance of our teacher, Mr. Sinusas. Daniel's secondary role is head of buisness and marketing
            in which he leads and coordinates development of our game's name, logo, tagline, packaging, etc in relation to a clearly identified
            target audience while also managing issues related to logistical and cost constraints. Unlike the rest of us, Daniel does not have a
        favorite game. </p>
        
        <h2> Meet Saige </h2>
        <p> Saige's primary role is 3D Artist. For this, she works on creating images on "Sprite" that we are going to use in our video game. 
            She made our character when it is standing still, in motion, picking stuff up, as well as the bakground when the game started and what it
            looks like when it ends. Saige's secondary role is graphic artist in which she leads and coordinates the creation and use 
            of the variety of art and other visual assets needed in the game project, such as a consistent use of fonts and colors. 
            In her leisure time, she likes playing "Undertale." </p>

        <h2> Our Average Gamer Types </h2>
        <p> After taking the short quiz, we identified that our gamer type is mostly socializer. To do this, we averaged the percentage 
            that we all got in each category.
             </p>
        <li> Socializer: 80% </li>
