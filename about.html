        <h1>About the Game Creator!</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Oge Okeke and I am a current senior attending the Engineering and Science University Magnet School in West Haven, 
            CT. Outside of school, I dance and have been dancing for 14 years. Other than dance,
            I like to hang out with my friends and watch Dance moms, which happens to be my favorite show.   
        </p>
        <h2> My Defintion of a Game </h2>
        <p>
            A game is a form of play that is based on certain contraints which could, but is not limited to rules.
        </p>
        <h2> My Gamer Types </h2>
        <p> After taking the short quiz, I identified that my gamer type is mostly socializer, which I got an 80 percent on. Below is the list of my gamer types by percent. </p>
        <li> Socializer: 80% </li>
        <li> Achiever: 47% </li>
        <li> Explorer: 40% </li>
        <li> Killer: 33% </li>
                       
        <h2> My Favorite Game </h2>
        <p> My favorite game is on roblox and it is called: "Dance Moms Roleplay." I like this game because it is based on the show "Dance Moms" and 
            allows me to be in the setting and create dance routines using the little tricks like spins, leaps, cartwheels, and more. Also, it's really fun to play with
            friends and create routines for pure entertainment. </p>
