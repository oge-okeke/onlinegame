        <h1>About the Game Creators!</h1>
        <p>
          On our team we have: Zofia, Oge, Daniel, and Saige. We are four high school students based in West Haven, CT.
            We all attend the Engineering and Science University Magnet School.
            
        <h2> Meet Zofia</h2>
        <p> Zofia's primary role is project manager and her secondary role is social impact engineer. For Zofia's roles, 
            he needs to make sure that our game reaches the correct audience and makes a 
            difference in the world whether that is a call to action or just staying informed. As the project manager, Zofia needs 
            to keep us all on task and make sure that we all are tackling a fair and equal amount of work. Outside of school, he likes anything that has 
            to do with fashion.   
   </p>
        
        <h2> Meet Oge </h2>
        <p> Oge's primary role is web designer and she is focusing on making sure our website is buisness ready. She includes every aspect that we worked on
            in this website. A secondary role that she works on is gameplay design. Oge reviews the way our game will work. 
            Oge leads and coordinates the design, testing, and revision of your game's play experience, including development of
            rules and instructions, and maximization of criteria like "flow" and "fiero" </p>
        <h2> Our Defintion of a Game </h2>
        <p>
            A game is a form of play that is based on certain contraints which could, but is not limited to rules.
        </p>
        <h2> My Gamer Types </h2>
        <p> After taking the short quiz, I identified that my gamer type is mostly socializer, which I got an 80 percent on. Below is the list of my gamer types by percent. </p>
        <li> Socializer: 80% </li>
        <li> Achiever: 47% </li>
        <li> Explorer: 40% </li>
        <li> Killer: 33% </li>
                       
        <h2> My Favorite Game </h2>
        <p> My favorite game is on roblox and it is called: "Dance Moms Roleplay." I like this game because it is based on the show "Dance Moms" and 
            allows me to be in the setting and create dance routines using the little tricks like spins, leaps, cartwheels, and more. Also, it's really fun to play with
            friends and create routines for pure entertainment. </p>
