    <h4> Jim, the main character, lives in a poorly taken care of neighborhood. 
        He has been seeing more and more trash regenerate every single day and it’s making the air unclean, and the neighbors more sick. 
        No one likes to be sick. Are you going to help? 
        Who is going to save the environment? His main goal is wanting to make it look more welcoming, 
        starting today he is going to pick up as much trash as possible! You, yes YOU, are capable of making it better! 
        Pick up bottles, cans, and more while dodging objects, make this neighborhood shine! 
      Keep in mind you have until it gets dark to pick up as much trash as possible, it can be dangerous outside when it's late.
