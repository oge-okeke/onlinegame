<h1> Social Issue to be Addressed </h1>
        <p> The social issue that we wanted to address via game is littering. 
            I want to address this social issue because it is still an ongoing issue in America and all over the world and one of the causes of the worldly disasters 
		that we face such as pollution, climate change, and more.
	   To track the effectiveness, this could be measured by seeing how much trash could be 
		collected within a certain time frame while trash regenerates as the screen becomes empty. The impact we will create 
		through this game is to prevent littering from continuing and to make better choices when 
		irresponsibly and carelessly disposing of trash. Another way to track the effectiveness of our game: before we say the name of the game 
		and give the instructions, we give the players a form to answer regarding littering 
		and then while they play the game, facts will pop up that they can read and then at the end, we give another 
		form for them to fill in and see how much they learned from it. Then, we will know how much information they gained.

<h2> Littering from the Perspective of Game Theory </h2>
       
<table>
  <!--
    "tr" is the tag for "table row", "th" is "table header", and
    "td" is "table data"
  -->
	<tr> 
		<th colspan="2" rowspan="2"><!--intentionally empty--></th>
		<th colspan="2">Player 2</th> 
    <!--
      "colspan" is an attribute for setting a table cell to
      occupy multiple horizontal spaces
      "rowspan" does the same for vertical spaces
    -->
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <!--
      Replace the generic "Choice 1", Outcome 1", etc. with the
      actual choices and outcomes for your social issue
    -->
		<td class="choice">Choice 1</td>
		<td class="choice">Choice 2</td>
    <!--
      By using classes here, we can later add CSS to style all 
      the "choices" to look the same
    -->
