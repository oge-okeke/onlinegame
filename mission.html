<h1> Social Issue to be Addressed </h1>
        <p> The social issue that we wanted to address via game is littering. 
            I want to address this social issue because it is still an ongoing issue in America and all over the world and one of the causes of the worldly disasters 
		that we face such as pollution, climate change, and more. </p>

    "tr" is the tag for "table row", "th" is "table header", and
    "td" is "table data"

		<th colspan="2">Player 2</th> 
    <!--
      "colspan" is an attribute for setting a table cell to
      occupy multiple horizontal spaces
      "rowspan" does the same for vertical spaces

      Replace the generic "Choice 1", Outcome 1", etc. with the

      By using classes here, we can later add CSS to style all 
      the "choices" to look the same
