<h1> Social Issue to be Addressed </h1>
        <p> The social issue that I would want to address via game is homelessness. 
            I want to address this social issue because it is still an ongoing issue in America and all over the world and one of the causes is
            the misuse and irresponisbility when it comes to money. </p>

  <!--
    "tr" is the tag for "table row", "th" is "table header", and
    "td" is "table data"
  -->
	<tr> 
		<th colspan="2" rowspan="2"><!--intentionally empty--></th>
		<th colspan="2">Player 2</th> 
    <!--
      "colspan" is an attribute for setting a table cell to
      occupy multiple horizontal spaces
      "rowspan" does the same for vertical spaces
    -->
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <!--
      Replace the generic "Choice 1", Outcome 1", etc. with the
      actual choices and outcomes for your social issue
    -->
		<td class="choice">Choice 1</td>
		<td class="choice">Choice 2</td>
    <!--
      By using classes here, we can later add CSS to style all 
      the "choices" to look the same
    -->
